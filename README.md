# Coffee(Xe)(La)TeX

## Installation

* put a symlink to your CoffeeXeLaTeX directory into a directory that is on LaTeX's search path; on OSX with
  LiveTeX, that could be `~/Library/texmf/tex/latex`.[1]

  [1]: obviously, you could put xour CoffeeXeLaTeX installation directly there, but that strikes me as
  'wrong'.
